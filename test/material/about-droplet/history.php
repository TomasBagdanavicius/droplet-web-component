        <p>We have come a pretty long way, so it's time to talk about the path taken and the history of our actions.</p>

        <p>One option would be to take just a single step back, which can be achieved with a special hyperlink (make sure to come back!):</p>

        <p><a href="#back" class="d-button">Take a step back</a></p>

        <p>The other option would be to take a closer look at the menu bar at the top. It can either be a breadcrumb bar or a navigation bar with back and home buttons (please refer to &ldquo;Customization&rdquo; example under &ldquo;Showcase &amp; Application&rdquo; section).</p>
