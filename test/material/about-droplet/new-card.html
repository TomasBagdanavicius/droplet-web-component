    <div id="content">

        <p>You have now opened a new card!</p>

        <p>The content for this new card was fetched over the network from the resource location that the link that you have just clicked is pointing to.</p>

        <p>All links (unless chosen otherwise) in Droplet's content area will be auto-captured to be processed internally by this web plugin.</p>

        <p>In this default setup a new card is represented by a breadcrumb item in the top clickable breadcrumb bar.</p>

        <p>We are sure you noticed the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> slide effect that was used to pull the new content into the view. We call it the <em>film-track</em> effect. Droplet supports 3 transition effects that are fully <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> driven:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><em>Film-Track</em></li>
            <li><em>Slide-Over</em></li>
            <li><em>Cross-Fade</em></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Now let's try the other <em>slide-over</em> effect with additional <em>cross-fade</em> and watch how it moves into view from below.</p>
