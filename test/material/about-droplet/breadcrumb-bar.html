        <p>Longer item titles in the menu bar will be truncated with an ellipsis. This should be visible on the current leftmost breadcrumb item.</p>

        <p>When you hit the current breadcrumb item (leftmost), the system will reload the content as well as the title with the latest text version.</p>

        <p>The breadcrum list can be scrolled through in horizontal direction. Go ahead and try it with your pointer.</p>

        <p>When you hit any item in the breadcrumb list, it will immediatelly go to that card and reload its content. You'll see a white flash for a split second, which indicates content refresh. Items to the left of the clicked item will be removed whereas items to the right will be preserved.</p>
