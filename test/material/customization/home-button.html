        <p>So the last element of the navigation bar is the Home button sitting on the right hand side.</p>

        <p>It wasn't visible neither on the start card, nor on the second card, because it wouldn't make sense. The start card obviously contains no action history, whereas the new card is fully covered by the back button only.</p>

        <p>But here we have the home button which will take you to the start card. Go ahead and click it to restart. We'll just leave you with that.</p>
