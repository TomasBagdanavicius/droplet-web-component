        <p>The so called navigation menu bar in this example shows only the current card title in the middle. As with breadcrumb bar, longer titles will be truncated with an ellipsis.</p>

        <p>If you wanted to reload the current card, you would hit the title in the menu bar.</p>

        <p>Here we also have a back button sitting on the left hand side. It's visible only when there is action history, hence no back button at the start.</p>

        <p>You can probably guess that there should also be a similar button on the right hand side.</p>
